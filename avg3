 pupil's marks were wrongly entered as 83 instead of 63. Due to that the average marks for the class got increased by half (1/2). The number of pupils in the class is:
[A].	10
[B].	20
[C].	40	
[D].	73
Answer: Option C

Explanation:

Let there be x pupils in the class.

Total increase in marks =		x x	1		=	x
                                2	    2
	x	= (83 - 63)   	x	= 20      x= 40.
  2	                2
